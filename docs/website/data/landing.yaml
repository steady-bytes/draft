  title: Simplify Operations
  subtitle: >
    While distributed systems help businesses and ideas scale, they often come with a high cost in terms of operational overhead and maintenance. Draft simplifies operations by standardizing inter-service
    communications, centralizing dynamic service configuration, and decoupling systm components. All of this is done using battle testing protocols and standards so that platforms built on Draft can scale
    in size without having to scale in complexity.
